This repo holds the code i've written for BAIBU (Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University).  
from OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Class. The coding concepts used are very basic and does not reflect my full skills.


## Usage/Examples

Every lesson has its own folder in `src` directory. you can try lessons by running the test file in their folder which ends with `Test.java`.
> Exception: if lesson folder has a single file then its considered a test file by default.


## Running Tests

While we weren't taught unit tests in class, i saw this as a great opertunity to include them.  
You can find unit tests in `tests` folder in main directory.
Selecting the folder and pressing run will run all unit tests in that directory.
> Not all lessons have unit tests! Only lessons that should be tested have them.

No more then 1 Unit test is used for a single exercise as the lessons themself are very basic, and don't need deep testing.
